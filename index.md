  ##### Shared Task: Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles @ BioNLP Workshop, ACL 2024
---


### Introduction
{: #intro}

Biomedical publications contain the latest research on prominent health-related topics, ranging from common illnesses to global pandemics. This can often result in their content being of interest to a wide variety of audiences including researchers, medical professionals, journalists, and even members of the public. However, the highly technical and specialist language used within such articles typically make it difficult for non-expert audiences to understand their contents.

<!-- Abstractive summarization can be used to generate a concise summary of an article, capturing its salient point using words and sentences that arenâ€™t used in the original text. As such, these models have the potential to help broaden access to highly technical documents when trained to generate summaries that are more readable, containing more background information and less technical terminology (i.e., a "lay summary"). -->

The BioLaySumm shared task surrounds the abstractive summarization of biomedical articles, with an emphasis on catering to non-expert audiences through the generation of summaries that are more readable, containing more background information less technical terminology (i.e., a "lay summary").

This is the 2nd iteration of BioLaySumm, following the success of the [1st edition](/2023) of the task at BioNLP 2023 [1] which attracted 56 submission accross 20 different teams. In this edition, we aim to build on last year's task by introducing a new test set, updating our evaluation protocol, and encouraging participants to explore novel approaches that will help to further advance the state-of-the-art for Lay Summarization. For inspiration, we provide some indeas of promising research directions [below](#prom).

### Registration and Submission
{: #reg}

<!-- **CodaLab page**: [https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12125](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12125) -->
**CodaLab page**: *coming soon!*


### Task Definition: Lay Summarization
{: #task}
 
Given an article's abstract and main text as input, the goal is for participants to train a model (or models) to generate the lay summary. Two separate datasets (derived from biomedical journals, PLOS and eLife) are provided for model training and will be used for evaluation. For the final evaluation, submissions will be ranked on the average performance across both datasets.

Note that submissions can be generated from either 2 separate summarization models (i.e., one trained on each dataset) or a single unified model (i.e., trained on both datasets). Participants will be required to indicate which approach was taken for each submission.

### Datasets
{: #data}
The data that will be used for the task is based on the PLOS and eLife datasets, published in [2]. Each dataset consists of biomedical research articles ( including their technical abstracts) and their expert-written lay summaries. The lay summaries of each dataset also exhibit numerous notable differences in their characteristics - for more details, please refer to [2].

PLOS is the larger of the two datasets, containing 24,773 instances for training and 1,376 for validation. eLife contains 4,346 instances for training and 241 for validation. These splits are identical to those used in [2].

The test data is composed of 142 PLOS article and 142 eLife articles. **Note: These test splits are different to those published in [2] and used for the 1st edition of BioLaySumm [1].**  

All data is provided via the competition CodaLab page.

### Evaluation
{: #eval}

<!-- Our evaluation will assess the quality of generated summaries along **3** dimensions: **(a)** Relevance, **(b)** Readability, and **(c)** Factuality. More information on this coming soon. -->
For both subtasks, we will evaluate generated summaries across three aspects: Relevance, Readability, and Factuality. Each evaluation aspect will be composed of multiple automatic metrics:

- **Relevance** - ROUGE (1, 2, and L) and BERTScore
- **Readability** - Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Dale-Chall Readability Score (DCRS), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), and LENS
- **Factuality** - AlignScore, SummaC

The scores presented for each metric will be the average of those calculated independently for the generated lay summaries of PLOS and eLife. The aim is to maximize the scores for Relevance metrics, Factuality metrics, and the LENS (Readability) metric and minimize scores for all other Readability metrics.

We will rank submissions based on each of these evaluation aspects independently. This will be done *after the test phase has ended* by applying min-max normalization to the scores of each metric, before averaging across metrics within each evaluation aspect. A ranking for each evaluation aspect will be computed as well as an overall ranking, which will be based on the best average score across all three aspects.

In the near future, we will update this section to provide a link to a worked example of the described ranking process.

### Promising Research Directions
{: #prom}

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Recent work has shown that the incorperation of external knowledge derived from graphs can help to improve the quality of generated summaries [3]. The automatic identification and retrieval of relevant textual knowledge is likely to provide similar benefits, and we encourage participants to explore this direction.

- **Controllable Lay Summarisation** - The lay summaries of PLOS and eLife exhibit numerous notable differences in their characteristics, including their length, readability, and abstractivness [2]. We encourage participants to explore the use of controllable generation techniques to produce summaries that are tailored to the characteristics of each dataset and enable models to cater to the needs of different audiences.

- **LLMs for Data Augmentation** - In the first edition of BioLaySumm [1], we found that the use of large language models (LLMs) proved benefitial for summary generation [4], but also for data augmentation [5]. We encourage participants to explore this direction further, and to consider potential new ways to use use LLMs for both summary generation and data augmentation.
